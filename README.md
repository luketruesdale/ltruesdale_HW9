## Project Description
This project is a web form implementation following best practices for usability, accessibility, and design. The form has been validated to ensure it meets HTML5 standards and WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility requirements.

## Best Practices for Web Forms
Our web form follows best practices to enhance user experience and ensure data integrity. Specifically:

- **User-Friendly Input Fields**: Each input field is labeled correctly with `<label>` elements to associate labels with form controls, making it easier for users to understand what data is required.
- **Validation & Error Handling**: HTML5 validation attributes such as `required`, `pattern`, and `maxlength` are used to ensure users provide correct data before submission. Additionally, error messages are user-friendly and provide clear instructions on how to fix input errors.
- **Logical Form Structure**: The form is structured in a logical order to minimize confusion and guide users through the input process smoothly.
- **Use of Bootstrap 5.3**: Bootstrap is used to style the form elements consistently, ensuring that the layout is clean and responsive across various screen sizes.
- **Security Considerations**: The form avoids unnecessary data collection and uses secure input types, such as `password` fields for sensitive information.

## Accessibility Considerations
Our form is designed to be accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Key accessibility features include:

- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance**: The form meets industry-standard accessibility guidelines, ensuring a broad range of users can interact with it.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Users can navigate through the form using the `Tab` key, ensuring ease of use for those relying on keyboard input.
- **ARIA Attributes**: Proper `aria-label` and `aria-describedby` attributes are used to enhance screen reader support.
- **Contrast & Readability**: The color scheme and typography have been chosen to maintain high contrast and legibility, accommodating users with visual impairments.
- **Responsive Design**: The form is designed to be accessible on different devices and screen sizes, ensuring usability across desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

By implementing these best practices, the form provides an intuitive, accessible, and efficient user experience for all visitors.
